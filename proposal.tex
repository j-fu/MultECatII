\subsection*{Extended Synopsis of the Proposal}

\paragraph{Background}
% Please include here:
% - Account of the problem
% - Motivation
% - Background
% - State of the art of research in this area
% - Preliminary work by the PIs


% - Account of the problem

The pivotal strategic importance of technologies based on electrocatalytic reactions is underlined in the recently approved National Hydrogen Strategy of the German Federal Government.  This initiative grants hydrogen, and in particular ``green hydrogen'' created with renewable energy a strategic role in the decarbonization of the economy as an energy carrier, an energy storage option, a sector coupling technology, a precursor for the chemical industry and a means for CO2 emission reduction in various industrial processes.
As a part of this strategy, the creation of hydrogen from electrical energy in electrolyzers and the reverse process -- the recovery of electrical energy from hydrogen in fuel cells -- are seen as indispensable technologies whose development shall be supported by R\&D investments and market incentives.
%
Both technologies are based on electro-catalytic reactions. Production and utilization of hydrogen are just two examples for this class of reactions, other electro-catalytic reactions are fundamental in post lithium batteries, material synthesis and other fields.

% - Motivation
The main driving forces for the rapid development of these technologies are (i) the synthetization of new electrode and electrolyte materials (e.g. ionic liquids and perovskites) (ii) the fabrication of nano-structured and composite electro-catalyitc surfaces (multi-material catalysts) and (iii) material and operational optimization. Central goal is to reduce cost, the main issue of large scale electro-catalysis due to high amount of expensive raw materials which are yet required (especially Pt and Pd). The Berlin based cluster of excellence UniSysCat, for example, searches for substitutions of these expensive materials.

% - Background
Investigations of electro-catalytic reactions on new materials  
are carried out by a number of  experimental techniques,  e.g.
RRDE    (Rotating   Ring    Disc   Electrode),   
% DEMS   (Differential Electrochemical  Mass  Spectroscopy), 
CV  (Cyclic  Voltammetry),  
STM (Scanning Tunneling Microscopy), 
% EQCM (Electrochemical Quartz Crystal Microbalance), 
SEM (Scanning  Electrochemical Microscopy),
AFM (Atomic Force Microscopy), 
EIS (Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy).

% - State of the art of research in this area

In order to interpret the experimental results, and to understand, predict and optimize electro-catalytic systems, various mathematical models have to be used. Depending on the level of complexity, modeling results can be expressed using analytic expressions or need to be obtained via numerical simulation.

Recent research by internationally leading groups more and more focuses on the interplay between mass transport, reactions and the electric field on the nanoscale, resolving double layer effects \cite{lin2019understanding,tan2018double,eden2019modeling,bohra2019modeling}.

All these approaches are based on homogeneous interfaces with no variation in their spatial structure. Especially they do not take into surface inhomogenities, which lead to variations on the electro-chemical activity.

% - Preliminary work by the PIs

WIAS research group RG7 represented by PI M. Landstorfer is active in the development of mathematical models for electrochemical systems.  A seminal result is in the derivation of a comprehensive electrolyte model which provides an accurate description of the electrochemical double layer and yields broad accordance to experimental data of single crystal electrodes.
Based on this, thermodynamically consistent boundary conditions for electro-chemical reactions at electrode surfaces derived from surface thermodynamics at the electrode-electrolyte interface have been developed \cite{DGM2013,DGL2014,Landstorfer2016187,landstorfer2017boundary}.

WIAS reserch group RG3 represented by PI J. Fuhrmann contributes to the numerical modeling of electrochemical systems, including the derivation of a thermodynamically consistent finite volume method \cite{JF2016} implementing the model \cite{DGL2014}. A similar discretization approach is used for the simulation of solide oxide electrolytes \cite{VagnerEtAl2019}.
Convergence investigations for different flux thermodynamically consistent flux expressions of finite volume schemes for unipolar drift-diffusion models have been performed in \cite{CCFG2020}, see also Fig. \ref{fig:fv}, left. The finite volume method for ion transport has been coupled to a pressure robust Navier-Stokes solver for electrolyte flow \cite{FGLMMSpringer2019,FuhrmannEtAlECActa2019}, see also Fig. \ref{fig:fv}, right.
The Julia language allows to utilize forward mode automatic differentiation to significantly reduce the implementation effort for strongly nonlinear problems reducing to reduce code complexity compared to C++ and to allow for easy distribution of the code based on a modern package management system.  The computational results in \cite{CCFG2020,VagnerEtAl2019} have been obtained by the new Julia package for finite volume methods \cite{VoronoiFVM} developed by the PI.



Recently published work\cite{JES}, supported by Math+ within the project MultECat, provides first results on modeling, simulation and validation of electro-chemical interfaces on polycrystalline materials (see Fig. \ref{fig:JES}). In addition a methodological approach to handle realistic multi-material surfaces was developed, allowing for a stochastic description of polycrystalline surfaces. Additional results on Debye--Hückel theory, concentration dependent susceptibilities, and electrolyte transport are in the final stage of publication. % HIER DIE ARBEITEN IN PREP HIn

\paragraph{Goals of the Project and Methodologies}
% Please include here:
% goals
% methodologies
Our recent results on modeling multi-material and polycrystalline metal-electrolyte interfaces are confined to the case of thermodynamic equilibrium without charge transfer reactions. This experimentally validated model framework is our starting point for non-equilibrium thermodynamic modeling of electron transfer reactions at multi-material electrodes coupled to charge transport in an electrolyte, taking into account  effects of polycrystalline interface structure, catalyst surface phase transitions, finite ion sizes, solvaticon, concentration dependent susceptibility.

In order to take into account  the heterogeneus structure of the interface, wie aim at a transition from surface patch labeling towards a description of a multi-material electrode in terms of  work function values  and their statistical distribution across the surface, extending  averaging methods as  developed in \cite{JES}  by periodic and statistical homogenization approaches.
%
These efforts shall result in  rate   equations  for polycrystalline interfaces  and their respective coupling to the bulk processes.

Many eletrocatalysts, in particular platinum free electrocatalysts for water splitting, have semiconductor properties, therefore we intend to extend the electrode models to the case of semiconductor - electrolyte interfaces.

Thermodynamically consistent discretization approaches which allow to preserve qualitative features of the continuous systems of equations  (second law of thermodynamics, mass conservation, positivity of concentrations) will be used to  develop numerical simulaiton models for multi-material electrocatalytic systems.  Preferably, models will be implemented in  Julia.

Model adaptivity strategies shall provide efficient ways to handle the different temporal and spatial scales inherent to the systems to be investigated. In particular they shall be able to decide between spatial resolution of the electrode boundary layers and the lumping of the relevant processes into interface models.


\paragraph{Main Contributions}
The envisioned modeling framework will allow to set up analytical and numerical simulation models for multi-material electrocatalytic systems  which in addition include features of electrochemical measurement processes, e.g. voltage cycling for CV or extraction of potential surfaces for STM.
The simulation  models shall be used to create series of prototypical synthetical measurement data which will be published in order be able to acquaint experimentalists with the modeling and simulation approach developed in the project and to serve as starting points for cooperation projects. Data publication preferably will  use the infrastructure developed in the framework of the NFDI4Cat consortium of the German recommended for funding under the National Research Data Initiative (NDFI) \cite{NFDI4Cat}, provisionally allowing to access measurement data by other groups.

The project will result in extended bulk-surface models for electrochemical systems which provide an ample field for further investigation in analysis and numerics. 
Classical electrode theory based on the Butler-Volmer equation will be generalized.  Upscaling and averaging methods for surface rate equations developed in the project are of interest in other applications.

Methodologies for consistent coupling of charge transport processes described by drift-diffusion systems and
corresponding numerical methods are investigate  in serveral other projects of the application area: Glitzky et al, Hömberg et al, Farrell et al.
