% - Account of the problem
% - Motivation
% - Background
% - State of the art of research in this area
% - Preliminary work by the PIs


% - Account of the problem

The pivotal strategic importance of  technologies based on electrocatalytic reactions
is underlined in  the  recently  approved  National Hydrogen  Strategy of  the  German
Federal  Government. This initiative  grants  hydrogen,  and  in   particular  ``green
hydrogen''  created with  renewable  energy a  strategic  role in  the
decarbonization of the economy as an energy carrier, an energy storage
option, a  sector coupling  technology, a  precursor for  the chemical
industry  and a  means  for  CO2  emission reduction  in  various
industrial  processes. 
As  a part  of this  strategy, the  creation of
hydrogen  from  electrical energy  in  electrolyzers  and the  reverse
process --  the recovery  of electrical energy  from hydrogen  in fuel
cells -- are seen  as indispensable technologies whose development
shall be  supported by  R\&D investments  and market  incentives.
%
Both technologies are based  on electro-catalytic reactions. Production
and utilization  of hydrogen are just  two examples for this  class of
reactions, other  electro-catalytic reactions  are fundamental  in post
lithium  batteries,  material  synthesis  and  other  fields. 

% - Motivation
The main driving forces for the rapid development of these technologies are (i) the synthetization of new electrode and electrolyte materials (e.g. ionic liquids and perovskites) (ii) the fabrication of nano-structured and composite electro-catalyitc surfaces (multi-material catalysts) and (iii) material and operational optimization. Central goal is to reduce cost, the main issue of large scale electro-catalysis due to high amount of expensive raw materials which are yet required (especially Pt and Pd). The Berlin based cluster of excellence UniSysCat, for example, searches for substitutions of these expensive materials.

% - Background
Investigations of electro-catalytic reactions on new materials  
%is one of  the main areas
%of research  in electrochemistry.  These  reactions take place  at the
%interface between  (mostly metallic)  catalysts and  electrolytes.
%They  are investigated  by a
are carried out by a number of  experimental techniques,  e.g.
RRDE    (Rotating   Ring    Disc   Electrode),   
% DEMS   (Differential Electrochemical  Mass  Spectroscopy), 
CV  (Cyclic  Voltammetry),  
STM (Scanning Tunneling Microscopy), 
% EQCM (Electrochemical Quartz Crystal Microbalance), 
SEM (Scanning  Electrochemical Microscopy),
AFM (Atomic Force Microscopy), 
EIS (Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy).
% - State of the art of research in this area

In order  to interpret  the experimental  results, and to understand,
predict and optimize electro-catalytic systems, various mathematical models
%on various scales and of
%various  levels of  accuracy 
have to be used. Depending  on the  level of  complexity,
modeling  results  can  be  expressed using  analytic  expressions  or
need to be obtained via numerical simulation.


% Showing the  relevance of mathematical and  numerical modeling, 
Recent research by  internationally leading groups  more and
more focuses  on the  interplay between  mass transport, reactions and the 
electric    field    on   the     nanoscale, resolving double layer effects \cite{lin2019understanding,tan2018double,eden2019modeling,bohra2019modeling}.

%The    authors    of
%\cite{lin2019understanding}          and         \cite{tan2018double},
%\cite{eden2019modeling} focus on models and simulation of these processes
%at nanoparticles or homogeneous  (single crystalline) electrodes based
%on     classical    Nernst-Planck     models.    The     authors    of
%\cite{bohra2019modeling} work in the  same direction using generalized
%Nernst-Planck models similar to those derived at WIAS.

All these approaches are based on homogeneous interfaces with no variation in their
spatial  structure. Especially they  do   not  take  into surface inhomogenities, which lead to variations on the electro-chemical activity.

%to   the
%\emph{e.g.} due to a polycrystalline structure  of the catalyst, the restructuring  of the
%catalyst surfaces depending  on various stages of the  reaction or due
%to defects like steps that create spots of increased activity.
%Moreover, these activities are lacking a strategy to upscale the nanoscale
%results to the macrocscale of real experimental or practical devices.

% - Preliminary work by the PIs
WIAS research group  RG7 represented by PI M. Landstorfer is active
in the development of mathematical models for electrochemical systems.
A seminal result is in the derivation of a comprehensive electrolyte model 
%which takes into account finite ion sizes, solvation effects and the influence of pressure.
%This model provides an 
which provides an accurate description of the electrochemical double and yields broad accordance to experimental data of single crystal electrodes. % of the double layer differential capacity of single crystal electrodes. % with respect to the applied voltage and
%with respect to the salt concentration.
%layers  and is  able to  predict qualitatively and in the correct quantitative range thedifferential capacity of single crystal electrodes with respect to the applied voltage and
%with respect to the salt concentration. 
Based on this, thermodynamically consistent boundary conditions for electro-chemical reactions at electrode surfaces based on a surface thermodynamics have been developed on the basis of surface thermodynamics \cite{DGM2013,DGL2014,Landstorfer2016187,landstorfer2017boundary}.

WIAS reserch group RG3 represented by PI J. Fuhrmann contributes to the numerical modeling of electrochemical systems,
including the derivation of a thermodynamically consistent finite volume  method \cite{JF2016} implementing
the model \cite{DGL2014}. A similar discretization approach is used for the simulation
of solide oxide electrolytes \cite{VagnerEtAl2019}. Convergence investigations for different flux
thermodynamically consistent flux expressions of  finite volume
schemes for unipolar drift-diffusion models  have been  performed in \cite{CCFG2020}, see also Fig. \ref{fig:fv}, left. The finite volume method for
ion transport has been coupled to a pressure robust Navier-Stokes solver for electrolyte flow
\cite{FGLMMSpringer2019,FuhrmannEtAlECActa2019}, see also Fig. \ref{fig:fv}, right.

Recently published work\cite{JES}, supported by Math+ within the project MultECat, provides first results on modeling, simulation and validation of electro-chemical interfaces on polycrystalline materials (see Fig. \ref{fig:JES}). In addition a methodological approach to handle realistic multi-material surfaces was developed, allowing for a stochastic description of polycrystalline surfaces. Additional results on Debye--Hückel theory, concentration dependent susceptibilities, and electrolyte transport are in the final stage of publication. % HIER DIE ARBEITEN IN PREP HIn

%for the different kinds of grains weighted with their respective surface fraction,

\paragraph{Goals of the Project and Methodologies}
% Please include here:
% - Goals of the project

Our recent results on modeling multi-material and polycrystalline electrodes-electrolyte interfaces are confined to the case of thermodynamic equilibrium without charge transfer reactions. This experimentally validated model framework is our starting point for the extension towards electro-catalytic reactions on heterogenous electro-catalytic surfaces.  

%% AB HIER SOLLTE JETZT DER TEIL HIN DEN WIR VORHIN BESPROCHEN HABEN
% -- BIS HIERHIN HAT ML ÜBERARBEITET

%Additional interim results %Hier kommen die arbeiten in prep. hin 
%particular, the achieved results provide valuable hints about the most relevant extensions of the modeling framework in order to describe electrocatalytic reactions.
%For example the dielectric susceptibility should depend on the local electrolytic %concentration
%and the temperature. 
%Oxide formation on inhomogeneous electrode surfaces can be modeled
%by non-monotonous potentials.
The investigation of the dynamics of spatially inhomogeneous reacting surfaces
should lead to effective description of the reactions on a more macroscoptic scale
and extend the stochastic characterization of the polycrystalline electrodes in equilibrium
to the non-equilibrium case.
%
Spatially resolved simulation of the model provides potential surfaces at
some given distance from the electrode surface, essentially corresponding to experimental STM measurements. 
The numerical solution of the transient system allows to simulate CV and to compute the corresponding current--voltage curve. 
This modeling approach is not restricted to CV and STM, but rather the general foundation for the interpretation of 
measurement techniques used in electro-catalysis research as described in the introduction.
%
Accompanied by the development
and implementation  of thermodynamically consistent  numerical methods
and codes, this improved theory of reactive polycrystalline electrodes
shall support  the modeling  of yet  not sufficiently  well understood
features  of experimental  results, with  a possible  outreach to  the
modeling  and simulation  of real  world systems  as described  in the
introduction.

% \todo{Wenn  es komplett neu sein soll:  solar hydrogen - coupling to Perovskites ? -> Koop mit
%   LG5, FU, Matera, Unisyscat, HZB, das war auch schon mal für Math+ angedacht.
%   RM: das sollte als ein Aspekt dazu}


% - Intended methodologies

The starting point  of the model development is  a general description
for the rate  equations of electrochemical reactions and their coupling to the bulk mass transport
and electrostatic potential at a homogeneous
electrode- electrolyte  interfaces based on the generalized Nernst-Planck-Poisson equations.
To account for non-constant dielectric susceptibility, the structure of the chemical potentials
needs to be extended in a thermodynamically consistent way.
Averaging methods as  developed in
\cite{JES}  are   extended  in   order  provide  rate   equations  for
polycrystalline interfaces  and their respective coupling to the bulk processes.

The modeling process is accompanied by the a numerical implementation based on the
thermodynamically consistent finite volume methods developed in RG3.
On one hand, this implementation will allow to verify the modeling process. On the other
hand the resulting code will be ready to be used in the context of experimental verification.
The development of the numerical schemes will be accompanied by the further investigations
on their thermodynamic consistency and the convergence.

The project can draw on a long-time experience with the use of finite volumes schemes for drift-diffusion systems.
The numerical models will be implemented in  Julia, utilizing forward mode automatic
differentiation to significantly reduce the implementation
effort for strongly nonlinear problems \cite{VoronoiFVM}, reducing the code complexity compared
to C++ and allowing for easy distribution of the code based on a modern package management system.
This implementation will draw on first successful Julia based computational results
for  different variants of generalized Schafetter-Gummel
schemes \cite{CCFG2020,VagnerEtAl2019} based on a new Julia package for finite volume methods \cite{VoronoiFVM}.
