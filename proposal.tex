\subsection*{Extended Synopsis of the Proposal}

\paragraph{Background}
% Please include here:
% - Account of the problem
% - Motivation
% - Background
% - State of the art of research in this area
% - Preliminary work by the PIs


% - Account of the problem

The strategic importance of technologies based on electrocatalytic reactions is underlined in the recently approved National Hydrogen Strategy of the German Federal Government.  It grants hydrogen, and in particular ``green hydrogen'' created with renewable energy a strategic role in the decarbonization of the economy as an energy carrier, an energy storage option, a sector coupling technology, a precursor for the chemical industry and a means for CO2 emission reduction in various industrial processes.
The creation of hydrogen from electrical energy in electrolyzers and the reverse process -- the recovery of electrical energy from hydrogen in fuel cells -- are seen as indispensable technologies whose development shall be supported by R\&D investments and market incentives.
%
Both technologies rely on electro-catalytic reactions. Production and utilization of hydrogen are just examples for this class of reactions, other electro-catalytic reactions occur in post lithium batteries, material synthesis and other fields.

% - Motivation
The main driving forces for the development of electrocatalytic technologies are (i) the synthetization of new electrode and electrolyte materials (e.g. ionic liquids and perovskites) (ii) the fabrication of nano-structured and composite electro-catalytic surfaces (multi-material catalysts) and (iii) material and operational optimization. Central goal for large scale electro-catalysis is cost
reduction by reducing the use of expensive raw materials like Pt and  Pd. E.g. the Berlin based cluster of excellence UniSysCat, searches for substitutions of these expensive materials.

% - Background
Investigations of electro-catalytic reactions on new materials  
are carried out by a number of  experimental techniques,  e.g.
RRDE    (Rotating   Ring    Disc   Electrode),   
% DEMS   (Differential Electrochemical  Mass  Spectroscopy), 
CV  (Cyclic  Voltammetry),  
STM (Scanning Tunneling Microscopy), 
% EQCM (Electrochemical Quartz Crystal Microbalance), 
SEM (Scanning  Electrochemical Microscopy),
AFM (Atomic Force Microscopy), 
EIS (Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy).

% - State of the art of research in this area

In order to interpret experimental results, and to understand, predict and optimize electrocatalytic systems, mathematical models have to be used.
Modeling results can be expressed as analytic expressions or need to be obtained via numerical simulation.
Research more and more focuses on the interplay between mass transport, reactions and  electric field on the nanoscale, resolving double layer effects \cite{lin2019understanding,tan2018double,eden2019modeling,bohra2019modeling}.
%
These approaches assume homogeneous interfaces with no variation in the spatial structure. They do not take into surface inhomogenities, which would lead to variations of the electrochemical activity.

% - Preliminary work by the PIs

WIAS research group 7 ``Thermodynamic Modeling and Analysis of Phase Transitions'' represented by PI M. Landstorfer is active in the development of mathematical models for electrochemical systems.  A seminal result is a comprehensive electrolyte model which provides an accurate description of the electrochemical double layer and yields broad accordance to experimental data of single crystal electrodes. Based on this, thermodynamically consistent boundary conditions for electrochemical reactions at electrode surfaces have been developed \cite{DGM2013,DGL2014,Landstorfer2016187,landstorfer2017boundary}.

WIAS research group 3 ``Numerical mathematics and Scientific Computing'' represented by PI J. Fuhrmann contributes to the numerical modeling and simulation of electrochemical systems. This includes  the derivation of a thermodynamically consistent finite volume method \cite{JF2016} for the electrolyte models \cite{DGL2014,VagnerEtAl2019}, implementations in Julia and C++, as well as convergence investigations for  different flux thermodynamically consistent flux expressions \cite{CCFG2020}.   %implementing the model 
 %A similar discretization approach is used for the simulation of solid oxide electrolytes \cite{VagnerEtAl2019}. Convergence investigations for different flux thermodynamically consistent flux expressions of finite volume schemes for unipolar drift-diffusion models have been performed in \cite{CCFG2020}, see also Fig. \ref{fig:fv}, left. The finite volume method for ion transport has been coupled to a pressure robust Navier-Stokes solver for electrolyte flow \cite{FGLMMSpringer2019,FuhrmannEtAlECActa2019}, see also Fig. \ref{fig:fv}, right.
%The Julia language allows to utilize forward mode automatic differentiation to significantly reduce the implementation effort for strongly nonlinear problems reducing to reduce code complexity compared to C++ and to allow for easy distribution of the code based on a modern package management system.  The computational results in \cite{CCFG2020,VagnerEtAl2019} have been obtained by the new Julia package for finite volume methods \cite{VoronoiFVM} developed by the PI.


Recently published work \cite{JES}, supported by MATH+ within the project MultECat, provides first results on modeling, simulation and validation of electrochemical interfaces on polycrystalline materials (see Fig. \ref{fig:JES}). A methodology to handle realistic multi-material surfaces was developed, allowing for a their stochastic description. Results on Debye--Hückel theory, concentration dependent susceptibilities, and electrolyte transport are in the final stage of publication. % HIER DIE ARBEITEN IN PREP HIn

\paragraph{Goals of the Project and Methodologies}
% Please include here:
% goals
% methodologies
Our recent results on modeling multi-material metal-electrolyte interfaces are confined to the case of thermodynamic equilibrium without charge transfer reactions. This experimentally validated model framework is our starting point for non-equilibrium thermodynamic modeling of electron transfer reactions at multi-material electrodes coupled to charge transport, taking into account polycrystalline interface structure, catalyst surface phase transitions, finite ion sizes, solvation, concentration dependent susceptibility.

In order to take into account  the heterogeneous structure of the interface, we aim at a transition from surface patch labeling towards a description %of a multi-material electrode in terms of  
on the basis of work function values of the multi-material electrode. This allows additionally for a statistical distribution across the surface. Further we intend to extend averaging methods as developed in \cite{JES}  by periodic and statistical homogenization approaches.
%
These efforts shall result in  rate   equations  for polycrystalline interfaces  and their respective coupling to the bulk processes.

Many eletrocatalysts, in particular platinum free electrocatalysts for water splitting, have semiconductor properties, therefore we intend to extend the electrode models to the case of semiconductor - electrolyte interfaces.

Thermodynamically consistent discretization approaches which allow to preserve qualitative features of the continuous systems of equations  (second law of thermodynamics, mass conservation, positivity of concentrations) will be used to  develop numerical simulation models for multi-material electrocatalytic systems.  Preferably, models will be implemented in  Julia.

Model adaptivity strategies shall provide efficient ways to handle the different temporal and spatial scales. % \eg double layer resolution vs. electro-neutrality condition. 
In particular they shall be able to decide between spatial resolution of the electrode boundary layers and the lumping of the relevant processes into interface models.

\paragraph{Main Contributions}
The envisioned modeling framework will allow to set up analytical and numerical simulation models for multi-material electrocatalytic systems including  features of  electrochemical measurement processes, e.g. voltage cycling for CV or extraction of potential surfaces for STM.
These simulation tools shall be used to create a series of prototypical synthetical measurement data, which can serve (i) as catalogue for experimentalists to (visually) compare their results to our modeling and simulation approach, (ii) as (labeled)  training sets for machine learning tools,  (iii) as database for parameter estimation. Data will be published using infrastructure developed by the NFDI4Cat consortium under the German National Research Data Initiative (NDFI) \cite{NFDI4Cat}, provisionally allowing to access measurement data by other groups.

The project will result in extended bulk-surface models for electrochemical systems which provide an ample field for further investigation in analysis and numerics. 
Classical electrode theory based on the Butler-Volmer equation will be generalized.  Upscaling and averaging methods for surface rate equations developed in the project are of potential interest in other applications.

Consistent coupling of charge transport to other physical processes and
corresponding numerical methods are investigated in several other projects of the application area AA2.

\paragraph{Future Research and New Horizons}
% Please consider the following aspects:
% - Describe the scientific novelties of the project compared to the state-of-the-art in the field of the project.
The establishment of material models for heterogeneously structured electrocatalytically active surfaces
provides the possibility of experimental comparison with polycrystalline or  multi-material electrodes
as they occur in electrochemical experimentation and in real world devices.

% - Highlight the long term research or application perspectives which will be opened by your project.
The ability to model and simulate processes at polycrystalline electrodes, and the communication pathway with experimentalists related to the publication of synthetic measurement data will be an excellent foundation
for collaborative research projects in the field of electrochemistry based e.g. on grants available through
the National Hydrogen Initiative.

% - Address potential future research questions / problem complexes which may be approached based on the results upon completion of the project work.
In the future, it will be possible to apply the methodology to various electrolyte-interface systems
and to set up inverse problems to interpret results of various measurement methods used to characterize real electrode surfaces. Upon experimental validation, the models can be used to optimize electrocatalytic processes.
The inclusion of semiconducting electrodes will be a starting point to develop models and simulation methods
for photocatalytic reactions.
The methodological framework and the resulting models will provide many open questions regarding their
mathematical and numerical analysis.
