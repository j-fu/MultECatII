abstract = {A continuum model for yttria-stabilized zirconia ({YSZ}) in the framework of non-equilibrium thermodynamics is developed.
Particular attention is given to (i) modeling of the YSZ-metal-gas triple phase boundary,
(ii) incorporation of the lattice structure and immobile oxide ions within the free energy model and
(iii) surface reactions.
A finite volume discretization method based on modified Scharfetter-Gummel fluxes is derived in order to perform numerical simulations.
The model is used to study the impact of yttria and immobile oxide ions on the structure of the charged boundary layer and the double layer capacitance. Cyclic voltammograms of an air-half cell are simulated to study the effect of parameter variations on surface reactions, adsorption and anion diffusion.},

 abstract = {Liquid electrolytes are fluidic mixtures containing electrically charged ions.
Electrochemical energy conversion systems like fuel cells and batteries contain liquid electrolytes.
In biological tissues, nanoscale pores in the cell membranes separate different types of ions inside the cell from those in the intercellular space.
Nanopores between electrolyte reservoirs can be used for analytical applications in medicine.
Water purification technologies like electrodialysis rely on the electrolytic flow properties.
This short and by far not exhaustive list of occurrences of electrolytic flow processes shows the importance of correct modeling of electrolyte flows.
Due to the complex physical interactions present in this type of flows, in many case numerical simulation techniques are required to facilitate a deeper understanding of the flow behavior.},

Numerical modeling provides a valuable tool to understand the strongly coupled nonlinear effects occurring in these systems.
This paper reviews a recently developed strategy to simulate electro-osmotic flows with finite ion size constraints, which uses a Voronoi finite volume method to discretize charge distribution and ion transport.
It demonstrates the demand for improved automatic mesh generation that is capable to provide problem dependent anisotropic meshes.},

abstract = {The most common mathematical models for electrolyte flows are based on the dilute solution assumption, leading to a coupled system of the Nernst–Planck–Poisson drift-diffusion equations for ion transport and the Stokes resp.
Navier–Stokes equations for fluid flow of the solvent.
In charged boundary layers the dilute solution assumption is in general not valid and volume exclusion and solvation effects have to be taken into account in a thermodynamically consistent way.
Whenever boundary layer effects have a dominant impact on the global behavior of a certain electrochemical system, an accurate numerical simulation depends on the correct incorporation of these effects.
In this contribution we present a novel numerical solution approach which aims at preserving on the discrete level consistency with basic thermodynamic principles and structural properties like independence of flow velocities from gradient contributions to external forces.
We illustrate capabilities of the method by an example of vortex generation due to induced charge electroosmotic forces at an electrode inside a nanochannel.},

elastic, viscous, heat conducting, reactive mixtures in contact with interfaces.
To this end, we first introduce bulk and surface balance equations that contain
several constitutive quantities. For further modeling of the constitutive quantities,
we formulate constitutive principles. They are based on an axiomatic introduction
of the entropy principle and the postulation of Galilean symmetry.
We apply the proposed formalism to derive constitutive relations in a rather abstract setting.
For illustration of the developed procedure, we state an explicit isothermal
material model for liquid electrolyte|metal electrode interfaces in terms of
free energy densities in the bulk and on the surface.
Finally, we give a survey of recent advancements in the understanding of
electrochemical interfaces that were based on this model.},

 abstract = {Electron transfer reactions are commonly described by the phenomenological Butler-Volmer equation which has its origin in kinetic theories.
The Butler-Volmer equation relates interfacial reaction rates to bulk quantities like the electrostatic potential and electrolyte concentrations.
Although the general structure of the equation is well accepted{,} for modern electrochemical systems like batteries and fuel cells there is still intensive discussion about the specific dependencies of the coefficients.
A general guideline for the derivation of Butler-Volmer type equations is missing in the literature.
We derive very general relations of Butler-Volmer structure which are based on a rigorous non-equilibrium thermodynamic model and allow for adaption to a wide variety of electrochemical systems.
We discuss the application of the new thermodynamic approach to different scenarios like the classical electron transfer reactions at metal electrodes and the intercalation process in lithium-iron-phosphate electrodes.
Furthermore we show that under appropriate conditions also adsorption processes can lead to Butler-Volmer equations.
We illustrate the application of our theory by a strongly simplified example of electroplating.},

At first we formulate a thermodynamic consistent model that resolves boundary layers at interfaces.
The model includes charge transport{,} diffusion{,} chemical reactions{,} viscosity{,} elasticity and polarization under isothermal conditions.
There is a coupling between these phenomena that particularly involves the local pressure in the electrolyte.
Therefore the momentum balance is of major importance for the correct description of the boundary layers.
The width of the boundary layers is typically very small compared to the macroscopic dimensions of the system.
In the second step we thus apply the method of asymptotic analysis to derive a simpler reduced bulk model that already incorporates the electrochemical properties of the double layers into a set of new boundary conditions.
With the reduced model{,} we analyze the double layer capacitance for a metal-electrolyte interface.},
